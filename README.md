# MercuryPass Client
Mercury Pass is a full stack project that was designed based on the guidelines of the university class "Web Systems".
This is the front-end side of it.   
Website can be accessed at [mercury-pass](https://mercurypass-ecd47.web.app/)  

# Description  
Mercury Pass represents a more elegant future where a traveller in Europe can use public transport easily and transparently.  
Since every city in every country has its own way of doing things, having a unified and straightforward system.  
A user can login using their Google Account or through an email link by using Firebase.  
Then they can "buy" a pass for a specific country.  
A very basic admin console has also been implemented but is not accessible for public use.
